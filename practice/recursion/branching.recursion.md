# Branching Recursion Problems

1.  ## Generate all subsets (power set) of an array
    -   At every index: include or exclude the element.
2.  ## Generate all subsequences of a string
    -   Include or skip each character to form different subsequences.
3.  ## Print all permutations of a string 
    -   Swap-based or visited-array branching to generate all
        permutations.
4.  ## Generate all combinations of balanced parentheses
    -   For n pairs, generate strings using '(' and ')' following rules.
5.  ## Solve the N-Queens problem 
    -   Place queens row by row ensuring no attack conditions.
6.  ## Print all paths in a maze (rat in a maze)
    -   Move in four directions: up, down, left, right (avoid walls &
        loops).
7.  ## Generate all subsets whose sum equals K (subset sum)
    -   Choose to include or exclude each number.
8.   ## Generate phone keypad combinations
    -   Map digits to letters and generate all strings.
9.  **Print binary strings of length N without consecutive 1s**
    -   Place 0 always, place 1 only when the previous was not 1.
10. **Print all integer partitions of a number N**
    -   Break N into all possible combinations of positive integers.
