✅ LEVEL–1: Very Easy (Beginner Backtracking Start)

These build basic “choose → recurse → undo” thinking.

1. Print all subsets of a string

Example: "abc" → ["", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]

2. Print all subsets of an array

Example: [1,2] → [[], [1], [2], [1,2]]

3. Print all sequences of length N using characters ‘a’ and ‘b’

For N=2 → "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

4. Print all binary strings of size N (0/1)

Classic simplest backtracking.

5. Print all ways to toss a coin N times (H/T)

Example: N=3 → HHH, HHT, …

✅ LEVEL–2: Easy (Classic Backtracking Pattern)

These teach swapping, undoing, and branching.

6. Print all permutations of a string

Your current topic. Example: "abc" → "abc", "acb", ..."

7. Print all permutations of an array

Example: [1,2,3].

8. Print all combinations of size K from array

Example: choose 2 from [1,2,3].

9. Print all ways to place K queens on board (not N queens)

Mini version → helps understand N-Queens later.

10. Print all valid parentheses strings of size N

Example for N=2: "(())", "()()".

11. Print all subsets whose sum equals target

Classic backtracking + pruning.

✅ LEVEL–3: Easy–Medium (Still beginner-friendly)

These connect recursion depth with constraints.

12. Generate all paths in a grid from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1)

Moves: Right or Down.

13. Rat in a Maze → print all paths

Moves: UDLR with visited[][].

14. Generate all placements of N items in M boxes

Small boxes problem to understand choices per row.

15. Print all ways to partition a string

Example: "abc" → ["a|b|c"], ["ab|c"], ["a|bc"]

16. String → all combinations using characters with duplicates

For example "aab".

17. Phone keypad combinations

Digits → letters (classic easy backtracking).

18. Subsets without using index++ (like permutations but with checks)

Helps build index logic discipline.

19. Generate all possible outcomes of rolling a dice N times

Each roll has 6 choices.

20. Place knights on a chessboard (small variant)

For example, place 2 knights on 3x3 without attacking each other.
