✅ 10 Basic Branching Recursion Questions


1. Print numbers from 1 to N using branching recursion

Write a recursive function that prints numbers from 1 to N, but each call branches into two calls until the base case.

2. Count number of ways to climb stairs (1 step or 2 steps)

Classic recursion:
ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)

3. Compute Fibonacci number using recursion

fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

4. Count subsets of a given set

Each element has two choices: include or not include.
Total recursive calls branch into 2 for each element.

5. Generate all subsets (power set)

Example: Input {1, 2} → {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}
Branch: include or exclude current element.

6. Print all binary strings of length N

Each position can be 0 or 1 → 2 branches per step.

7. Count all paths from top-left to bottom-right in a grid (only move right or down)

Two branches:
count(r, c) = count(r+1, c) + count(r, c+1)


skip as of now.
8. Tower of Hanoi (very basic branching recursion)

Move disks from A to C using B.
Recurrence:
T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 + T(n-1)

9. Sum of all subsets (subset-sum using branching recursion)

At each step:

take the element

skip the element
→ Two branches.

10. Generate all permutations of a string (swap method)

Choose each character as first, then recursively permute the rest.
